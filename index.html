            <p class="familyParagraph">I am a husband to my beautiful wife Katherine, and am a father to two children; Vivian and Ezekial. Family has always been very important to me, and I value being close to them. I'm blessed to be living in San Antonio, and to have so much of my extended family livng here as well. It's so amazing watching my children growing up, and I'm thankful that they're doing it surrounded by grandparents, aunts and uncles, and lots of cousins! </p>

            <p class="teachingParagraph">I love teaching and have taught, full time, for four years now. I attended Anderson University, where I received a degree in music educaiton. I have taught Middle School Math, Digital Literacy, Digital Citizenship, FLL Robotics, MS and HS Choir, MS General Music, and Keyboard. I currently teaching at Cornerstone Christian Schools. No matter what I am teaching, I love to watch the "lightbulb" go off when a student finally unlocks a new understanding! </p>

            <p class="musicParagraph">I started piano lessons when I was five years old. It was a natural fit, and I moved through my books quickly. I have been playing piano ever since, with the highlight being my performance of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata during my senior recital in college. I also play tenor saxophone and viola. I love to be part of an ensemble, and the thrill of experiencing so much hard work coming together into something beautiful.</p>

            <p class="gamingParagraph">I'm a gamer through and through. The first system I ever had was my dad's old Nintendo Entertainment System. The mechanism that held down the game cartridge was broken, so it would only work if you stuck a rolled up sock inside of the conosole. Some of my foundest memories are playing Super Mario Bros. 3 with my family. My favorite series are Megaman, The Legend of Zelda, Metal Gear Solid, Dark Souls, and Assassin's Creed.</p>

            <p class="codingParagraph">I have had a life long interest in technology, and after teaching myself some basic coding, in an effort to try to create my own games, I have discovered a new passion! I love the puzzle of trying to making everything work exactly the way I want it to, and the pride from looking at a finished product that was created through hardwork and perserverance! I am a ways off from making my own games, but I'm getting there one project at a time!</p>
